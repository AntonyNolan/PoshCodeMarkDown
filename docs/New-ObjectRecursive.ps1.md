# new-objectrecursive.ps1 - 

## Description

i saw few questions about this functionality on vug, so i decided to give it a try and create function that would allow user to created object with nested objects. i needed to have also possibility to define type of nested object, so iâ€™ve used key in hashtable to define it, if exists. works fine now with windows.forms

     .Synopsis
         Creates new object based on hashtable definition
     .Description
         Function is wrapper for New-Object that allows user to create nested objects using nested hashtable as definition.
         If you want to take advantage of type use 'Type' key within hashtable that defines object.
     .Example
         $obj = New-ObjectRecursive @{Test = @{ InnerTest = 'Value'; AnotherInner = 'Another'; InnerwithInner = @{ Deepest = 'It is very deep'}}; Flat = 'SomeValue'}
         $obj.Test.InnerwithInner.Deepest
         It is very deep
         
         Create simpe custom object with several inner psobjects, depending of hashtable structure.
     .Example
         (New-ObjectRecursive @{ Type = 'Windows.Forms.Form'; Size = @{ Type = 'Drawing.Size'; width = 400; Height = 400}; Text = 'Title of window'}).ShowDialog()
         
         Display windows form of size 400 x 400 and title 'Title of window', assuming Windows.Forms are loaded.
